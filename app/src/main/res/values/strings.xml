    <string name="description">
     \nBidding Tic Tac Toe:\n\nThe only modification in Bidding tic tac toe is that it is not an Alternate turn game.
Instead, both players start with 100 chips each in their account. Now, as the name suggests,
        each player needs to place a bid before his turn. None of the player is aware of the
        opponent’s bid, until both of them chooses their respective bids. Whoever places the
        higher bid gets to play.\n\nAn interesting twist is that the player with higher bid is
        required to give his chips (only bidded ones) to the player who bidded less.
        The motive of the game is same as normal tic tac toe game irrespective of the chips left in the end.\n\nNote - Occasionally, if the two players submit the same bid, they are needed to choose their bids
        again. If none of the player want to change their bid, it’s concluded as a draw.

        \n\nCustom Tic Tac Toe:\n\nSelect board size and objective in 2 player primitive game. Here, objective means the number of
        continuous marks (X or O) in order to win the game.
