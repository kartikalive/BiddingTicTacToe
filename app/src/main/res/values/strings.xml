     \n
        In regular tic tac toe, both the players get alternate chances. Bidding Tic Tac Toe is a variant of that.
    \n\n
    Player A has $x amount and player B has $y amount as initial balance. Assume that y>x.
\n\n
    Both the players bid some amount from the available amount to them. whichever bids higher will get the turn to put a mark on the board and the winner for that bid has to subtract the bidding amount from his/her available balance.
\n\n
    Player A does not know the bidding amount of player B and vice versa but a referee is there who will announce the remaining balance amount of each player after each move. Both the players know initial amount of each other.
